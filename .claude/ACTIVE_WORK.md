# Active Work Status

Live "who is doing what right now" board — separate from `CURRENT_TASK.md`,
`PROJECT_STATE.md`, and `handoffs/latest.md`, which record *finished* work.
This file records *in-progress* work so the other agent can avoid colliding
(touching the same files, the same shared database schema, or pushing/
deploying at the same time).

Read this at the start of every task (part of mandatory startup). Only edit
your own section — never the other agent's. Update it:
- the moment you start a task: set Status to `in-progress`, fill in Task/
  Started/Last updated.
- at natural checkpoints during a long task (refresh Last updated).
- the moment you finish: set Status to `idle`, clear Task, and put the
  actual result in `CURRENT_TASK.md`/`PROJECT_STATE.md`/`handoffs/latest.md`
  as usual — this file is not a history log, it gets overwritten every time.

Neither agent runs continuously in the background — "checking periodically"
in practice means checking here at the start of each new task/turn, which is
already mandatory. There is no live polling.

Status: in-progress
Task: User-directed priority #1 of 3: wire real Knowledge/Pinecone search (KnowledgeSyncService.search()) into the live AI receptionist conversation flow, which currently uses a plain in-memory lookup in receptionist-simulator.ts — investigating scope now. #2 (live Twilio/Vapi certification) and #3 (backup-restore drill) queued next, both need the user's direct involvement.
